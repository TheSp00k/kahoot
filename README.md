# Kahoot! game Instructions
* I have used css-in-js library for styling the application. The styles are defined in `.styles.ts` files as variables and exported from there.
* All the data is stored inside of the `app.mocks.ts` file. There you can add more game items or edit them. Note that the ids of the game items must be unique.

## Setup

```
$ npm install
```

## Running

```
$ npm start
```

## Build

```
$ npm run build
```
